#' This function models simultaneuous adaption and produces the desired binary mask.

#' @param M Matrix of observed entries. The input should be N (number of units) by T (number of time periods).
#' @param N_t Number of treated units desired.
#' @param T0 The time just before treatment for all treated units. For instance, if T0 = 2, then first two entries of treated units are counted as control and the rest are treated.
#' @param treat_indices Optional indices for treated units. The default is sampling N_t unit from all N units randomly. However, user can manually set some units as treated.
#' @return The masked matrix which is one for control units and treated units before treatment and zero for treated units after treatment.

#' This function models staggered adaption and produces the desired binary mask.
#' @param M Matrix of observed entries. The input should be N (number of units) by T (number of time periods).
#' @param N_t Number of treated units desired.
#' @param T0 The first treatment time. The rest of treatment times are equally spaced between T0 to T.
#' @param treat_indices Optional indices for treated units. The default is sampling N_t unit from all N units randomly. However, user can manually set some units as treated. Note that indices should be sorted increasingly based on their T0.
