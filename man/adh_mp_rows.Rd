\title{Computing Synthetic Control Estimator when multiple units are missing.}
\usage{
adh_mp_rows(M, mask, niter = 10000, rel_tol = 0.00000001)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Matrix of observed entries. The input should be N (number of units) by T (number of time periods).}

\item{mask}{Binary mask with the same shape as M containing observed entries.}

\item{niter}{Optional parameter on the number of iterations taken in the algorithm. The default value is 10000 and if the number of treated units are large for speed consideration will be reduced to 200.}

\item{rel_tol}{Optional parameter on the stopping rule. Once the relative improve in objective value drops below rel_tol, execution is halted. Default value is 1e-8.}
}
\value{
The matrix with all missing entries filled.
}
\description{
The underlying algorithm is Mirror Descent with
Entropy Regularizer. This algorithm is also known as exponentiated
gradient descent. It is worth noting that this estimator was
proposed by Abadie et. al and the reason of new implementation here
is to compare methods on some datasets.
